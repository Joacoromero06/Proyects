    "A **recurrence relation** is a mathematical construct used to define a sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ recursively, where each term $a_n$ is expressed as a function of preceding terms $(a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \\dots, a_{n-k})$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Definition**:  \n",
    "For a sequence $\\{a_n\\}$, a recurrence relation is an equation of the form:  \n",
